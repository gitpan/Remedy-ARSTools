			- reloads field definition data when missing config data
			- automatically reconnects on ARERR161 type errors
			- converts strings to integers for enum fields
			- removed snarky comments
			- rewrote documentation, removed even more snarky comments
			- removed 'timeout' option
			
0.92	Tue Oct 17 21:45:35 GMT 2006
		added 'timeout' option. If set, the control structure is reloaded if last access 
		was more than that long ago
		goddam this module needs a rewrite like a new set of drawers. it's FUNKY in there! ;-)

0.91	Tue Mar 21 16:16:25 GMT 2006	
		modified checkFieldLengths to accept blessed references on the Fields argument.

0.9		Fri Jul  9 09:46:50 EDT 2004
		well crap! 0.6 sais I added truncate, but damn if I can find it in the code
		now ... added the TruncateOK => 1 option to CheckFieldLengths that will 
		truncate long fields. CreateTicket and ModifyTicket will pass this option
		allong to CheckFieldLengths.

0.8		01/30/04 16:12:02
		still carrying all the "things to do"
		CreateTicket now spews field value submissions in Debug mode

0.7 	05/12/03 21:50:47
		now exports procedural methods to calling namespace
		nothing else added/changed, so considder all the "things to do" 
		from .06 be the things to do for .08
		procrastination is the mother of intervention.

0.6		05/05/03 21:50:35
		added TruncateFieldLengths, and Truncate support to CreateTicket and ModifyTicket.
		Pod updated to reflect new options to CreateTicket and ModifyTicket.
		-Things To Do for 0.7:
		add docs to pod for actual TruncateFieldLengths method
		add better port switching via: ars_SetServerPort(ctrl, serverName, TCPport, RPCnumber)
		add the self-healing config
		legit test suite
		switch GenerateARSConfig to _GenerateARSConfig (fix autosplit problem)
	
0.5 	Wed 10/30/02 11:27:02
		initial release to CPAN under Remedy::ARSTools namespace
		added ParseDiay
   	 	added ParseDBDiary
		added support for auto-generating config files at object creation
		added support for auto-regenerating config files when fields not found
		modified RefreshConfig
		added GenerateConfig
		added GenerateARSConfig
		added GetFieldData
    	-Still To Do:
		'AutoConfig' automatically refresh ConfigFile upon field data exceptions
		Write Test Suite.
		Make complains about GenerateConfig and GenerateARSConfig: that they are
		not unique when truncated to 8 chars. Fix in next release.
